# Chords & Scales

## What?
The program allows users to check piano chords and scales, listen to them, and export four bars of chords as a MIDI file.

## Why?
I developed this program to practice XAML and improve my skills in C#. While this was a valuable exercise, I plan to recreate the software as a web application in the future.
